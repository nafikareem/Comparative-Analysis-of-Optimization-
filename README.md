# Comparative Analysis of Optimization Methods in Feature Selection and Predictive Model Parameters in the Construction Industry

The construction industry significantly contributes to global economic growth but is also a major source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly 40% of global greenhouse emissions. These emissions predominantly result from the operation of heavy machinery and production processes. This study explores predictive modeling techniques for estimating emissions from construction equipment, focusing on NOx, HC, and CO gases. Machine learning models such as MLP Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Bagging Regressor are utilized to evaluate their predictive performance.

The study emphasizes the importance of hyperparameter optimization, employing methods like Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Cross Entropy (CE) to enhance model accuracy and computational efficiency. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) serves as the primary metric for evaluating prediction accuracy. Initial results highlight that MLP Regressor outperforms other models with an RMSE of 0.352, demonstrating its capability to handle complex nonlinear relationships. However, advanced optimization methods yield significantly improved performance across models, reducing RMSE to as low as 0.0027.

The findings underscore the potential of machine learning and optimization techniques in addressing environmental challenges within the construction sector. Future work involves extending experiments to datasets with high skewness and kurtosis, refining the models, and publishing the findings in a reputable international journal.
